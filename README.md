## Stakeholders
### **Stakeholder 1: Zoey**

**Age:** 21

**Background:** An international student living in a shared apartment. Busy with school during the week, usually cooks simple meals at home after class, and does bulk grocery shopping on weekends.

**User Type:** Time-constrained student who wants to eat healthily and stay on budget.

**Problems / Frustrations:**

* Often forgets what’s left in the fridge and ends up buying duplicates.
* Doesn’t know how to prioritize using soon-to-expire ingredients, leading to food waste.
* Suffers from “choice overload” and doesn’t have time to spend half an hour browsing recipe sites.
* Frequently forgets key ingredients while shopping, making recipes incomplete.

**Goals / Needs:**

* Generate recipes based on fridge inventory and expiry dates → **Waste-Reducing Recipes**
* Generate recipes and shopping lists based on sudden cravings → **On-the-Spot Lists**
* Get reminders about soon-to-expire ingredients → **Expiry Alerts**

### **Stakeholder 2: Sitong**

**Age:** 28

**Background:** A new mother taking care of a baby at home while her husband works. Needs to balance childcare and housework, leaving very limited time and energy.

**User Type:** Users who need efficient meal planning and grocery management.

**Problems / Frustrations:**

* Difficult to go grocery shopping with a baby; long lists are hard to manage, especially when multiple people are involved.
* Different family members have different dietary needs (postpartum nutrition vs. husband’s weight loss vs. baby’s complementary food), which are hard to balance.

**Goals / Needs:**

* Quickly generate shopping lists tailored to preferences and needs to save time at the supermarket → **Personalized Lists**
* Get recipe recommendations for different family members’ dietary needs (low oil, low salt, balanced nutrition, postpartum care, weight loss, baby meals) → **Personalized Recipes**
* Enable family collaboration so her husband can pick up items on his way home → **Collaborative Shopping**

### **Stakeholder 3: Jason**

**Age:** 29

**Background:** A single professional living alone. Busy with work, has limited cooking skills, but is highly focused on fitness and nutrition (high-protein, low-fat). Limited kitchen tools and condiments.

**User Type:** Single fitness-focused users who care about diet structure but lack cooking experience.

**Problems / Frustrations:**

* Lacks cooking skills and gives up when recipes look too complicated.
* Needs to control protein and calorie intake precisely for fitness but doesn’t know how to calculate it.
* Lacks variety and inspiration; ends up eating chicken breast and broccoli all the time.

**Goals / Needs:**

* Access simple, easy-to-cook recipes (15–20 minutes, no complex tools required).
* Track daily nutritional intake to ensure protein and calorie goals are met → **Nutrition Tracking**
